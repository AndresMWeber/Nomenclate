# List of configurations written in YAML
#
# So far the suffixes is a look up dictionary for Maya objects, however I will be adding support for more later.
# To properly enter a naming format string:
#
# Enter all fields you want to look for with a special look up word you want to use
# as a descriptor for that naming token e.g. -
#                                       name
# and place it where you want it in order in the formatting string you set.
# If you want something to space out or separate the names just input whatever separator
# you want to use like _ or . and it will keep those for usage.
#
# Name the format whatever sub-section name you think is appropriate with an appropriate header
#
# If you want them camel cased for example name and type:
#                                       nameType
# and it will do the camelcasing for whatever you input.
#
# If you want a static string to always be present in a format string just
# enclose it with parenthesis, for example a version:
#                                       (v)version
# if version is 3 and your version padding config is set to 2
# will evaluate to
#                                       v02
#
#
#  There are 3 naming tokens with specific formatting functions that will give you customized results
#  You can designate multiple fields for added granularity by adding a number after e.g. var1, var2
#       <var> - this depends on var in the config being set to upper or lower
#             a -returns a character based on position in alphabet, if you go over it starts aa -> az -> ba -> bz etc.
#             A - returns a character based on position in alphabet, if you go over it starts AA -> AZ -> BA -> BZ etc.
#       <version> - will return a string number based on the version_padding config setting
#       <date> - will return a date as a string based on a datetime module formatted string
#              that the user will input or default to YYYY-MM-DD
#              full list of options can be found here:
#              https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
#              please specify whichever separators (or lack of) you want to override the default behavior
#              just modify the config
#
#  If you need any custom token conversion functions you can specify them by extending the nomenclate class with methods
#  with the following naming structure: convert_<token>(self, token_data) which should return a string
#
#  Otherwise, unless you specify an options list for a specific naming token
#  it will just replace the text with whatever you set that naming token to
#  on the nomenclate object.  The options lists will be used as a filter for the
#  naming token validity or as a look up table for UIs and if you specify
#  different lengths after it, it will use the first in the list unless
#  otherwise specified in the overall_config section under "<naming_token>_length"
#  If there is no abbreviation list afterwards then just write it as a list with -
